Javel todo task list:

1) Implement the InnerClasses attribute decoding.
   For each class in the list, open the file and decode it (if found),
   then output it inside the main classe.

2) Implement the Synthetic attribute. Output an information if present.

3) Implement the LocalVariableTable attribute. Display in the code
   the local variable name and type, with the scope range [pc, pc+length[.

4) Implement the Deprecated attribute. Output an information if present.

5) Transform the long code_info::disassemble() method in a list of
   small class calls, with a class for each opcode (with templates for
   opcodes that are almost the same).

6) Decode code and build a call tree for each method, then perform check
   analysis on stack usage, deadcode, calling branches...

7) Try to implement a *complete* code disassembler which output real
   java instructions instead of opcodes.

8) Handle real Utf-8 support with decoding to local page encoding.

9) Output class file in XML format.

1. Installation

	As usual.

		$ make
		$ su
		$ make install

	Please note that we do not use automake/autoconf for the moment.
	Later perhaps. The make has been tested on a standard linux box
	only. Install will copy javel onto /usr/local/bin/ and javel.1.gz
	(the man page) onto /usr/share/man/man1/. Needs the stdc++ lib v3.

2. Usage

	To display a complete man page:

		$ man javel

	To display a quick usage reminder:

		$ javel -help

	To disassemble everything from a class 'Brol.class':

		$ javel -private -verbose -c Brol.class
